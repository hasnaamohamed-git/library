## Backend Setup
- [x] Create project directory
- [ ] Initialize npm and install dependencies (express, mysql2, bcryptjs, express-session, body-parser, cors)
- [ ] Create database schema (users, books, borrowings, reservations, fines)
- [ ] Set up database connection (db.js)
- [ ] Create server.js with middleware and route imports
- [ ] Implement auth routes (register, login, logout)
- [ ] Implement books routes (search, add, edit, delete)
- [ ] Implement borrow routes (borrow, return with fine calculation)
- [ ] Implement reserve routes (reserve book)
- [ ] Implement fines routes (view fines, pay/waive fines)
- [ ] Implement admin routes (manage users, view reports)

## Frontend Setup
- [ ] Create HTML pages (index.html, login.html, register.html, dashboard.html, admin.html)
- [ ] Create styles.css for responsive design
- [ ] Create app.js for client-side logic (login, register, search, borrow, reserve, dashboard)

## Logic Implementation
- [ ] Fine calculation algorithm ($0.50/day overdue)
- [ ] Reservation queue management (FIFO, notifications)
- [ ] Borrowing eligibility checks (no overdue books, fines < $10)
- [ ] Book status transitions (Available, On Loan, Overdue, Reserved, Lost)
- [ ] Error handling and notifications

## Testing
- [ ] Test user registration and login
- [ ] Test book search and borrowing
- [ ] Test reservations and returns
- [ ] Test fine calculations
- [ ] Test admin functions and reports
- [ ] Test edge cases (overdue books, multiple reservations, etc.)

## Deployment
- [ ] Ensure all dependencies are installed
- [ ] Run database setup
- [ ] Start server and verify functionality
